# Simple REST API with Express.js
A basic RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js, demonstrating fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project serves as a starting point for developing more complex web services.

Description
This project implements a simple REST API for managing a collection of "items" (e.g., tasks, products, users). It provides endpoints to perform common operations like retrieving all items, getting a single item by ID, adding a new item, updating an existing item, and deleting an item.

Features
CRUD Operations: Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

Express.js Framework: Leverages the robust and flexible Express.js framework for routing and middleware.

JSON Data Handling: Communicates using JSON for request and response bodies.

Modular Structure: Organized code for easy understanding and extension.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

Nodemon (optional): A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected (for development).

Installation

Usage / API Endpoints
Once installed, you can start the server and interact with the API using tools like Postman, Insomnia, curl, or even your web browser for GET requests.
